            <p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the
                 years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[6][7] followed by disappointment
                  and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[8][9] followed by new approaches,
                   success and renewed funding.[7][10] AI research has tried and discarded many
                    different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling 
                    human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating
                     animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical
                      machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful,
                       helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia</p>
